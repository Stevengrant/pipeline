# PEER REVIEW
* More commenting throughout the code for easier understanding, especially with the relationships/models.
* ApplicationUser boolean of isAdmin could've been improved as a sub-class or interface.
* For the most part the code base was DRY and readable.
* In general the code base was well organized.
* Home controller was over-burdened and would've benefited from having a more specific purpose.
* README was lacking instructions on how to run the app, which would be vital to a new member of the team.
* Zombie code should've been removed.
* POST mapping technically should've been a PUT mapping for the update route.
* Could've used a JS snippet to achieve an easy clipboard copy button for the Candidate User link.
